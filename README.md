## FAQ

### *What is this?*

This is the *test* website for FASA at VT. Changes are made here before they go live to preview them.

### *Why is it on GitHub?*

We are using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) because it is:  
 - Fast: Changes are reflected within a few minutes
 - Easier to work with:
   * Bad change? Changes are easily reversible.
   * HTML knowledge isn't needed for simple edits
 - Free: by using Pages, hosting costs are non-existant.

### *What needs to be done?*

So far:  
 - Migrate all of the existing content from old site to new
 - Write documentation (so it makes sense what each bit does)

### *I like the theme, where can I see more about it?*

The theme being used is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose.
