## FAQ

### *What is this?*

This is the website source code for FASA at VT. We use Jekyll to build the site but the code exists here so that it can get built in the cloud using Docker.

### *What needs to be done?*

So far:  
 - Set up automatic building with Docker
 - Write documentation (so it makes sense what each bit does)

### *I like the theme, where can I see more about it?*

The theme being used is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose.
