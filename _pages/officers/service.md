**Political Science**  

> Hi FASA! I'm Hannah and I am 1/3rd of your Service chairs for this year. I'm one of the biggest fangirls you will ever meet and yes I know I look taller in pictures.

### **What is your dream job and why?**

### **What is your biggest pet peeve and why?**

> *I cannot stand slow walkers or big groups who take up the WHOLE walkway. It drives me crazy! It doesn't hurt to be courteous and not take up the whole path and slow walkers are like slow drivers who drive under the speed limit to me.*
