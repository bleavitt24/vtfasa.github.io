### **Dream Job (and why)?**

> *My dream job is to be a diplomat.

### **If you could own a restaurant, what would it be named and what kind of food would it sell?**

> *I’d call it “Halo Hello” and it would be a Filipino food truck! There’d be  lumpia, pancit, tocino, longanisa, adobo, etc. There’d also be smoothie bowls and (of course) halo-halo!!*
