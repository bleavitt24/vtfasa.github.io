**International Relations and History**  

> What's up I'm Joy and I am a International Relations and History Major here at Virginia Tech. I grew up in Virginia Beach and Yokosuka, Japan and being here at Blacksburg has given me some unique and wild experiences in just one year. I can't wait to be FASA's D7 rep and will do my best to keep Tech hype in the district 😤💪🏽

### **What are some of your favorite hobbies?**

> *Watching horror movies and messing around with my friends.*

### **What is your description of a perfect day?**

> *Classes from 10am - 2pm, getting all my work done around 5 or 6, eating dinner with a friend at 7, and hanging out or going out with my friends for the rest of the night.*

### **If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?**

> *Japan, because the lifestyle is so much calmer than the lifestyle in America, the food and people are great and I personally think the scenery is beautiful.*

### **What would your rapper name be?**

> *JKillaVilla*
