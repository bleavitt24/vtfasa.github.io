**Chemistry**

> What’s up!!! I am the 2019-2020 FASA Sports Chair!!! I went to Falls Church High School and I was a part of the football team for three years and a captain my senior year. I also play basketball, but my main sport is football. Here at Virginia Tech, other than FASA, I started an organization, Build The Future at Virginia Tech, that focuses on providing the necessary supplies, food, and resources for kids to succeed in the Blacksburg and Christiansburg area. I love working with kids and giving back to my community so I encourage you to ask me more about the organization and join!!! I’m also a TA for a Chemistry First Year Experience class by helping students figure out what careers are available for Chemistry majors after college and also assisting them in their transition to Virginia Tech. A couple other things I like to do is play video games, especially sports and fighting games like Madden, NBA 2K, Mortal Kombat, and Super Smash Bros Melee and Ultimate. On the side, I DJ because I have loved music my entire life, but was never good at playing an instrument. I love DJing because I can connect with people by playing music everyone can enjoy and I’m broke, so it’s good way to make some extra cash. I’m so excited this year to get to know all the new members and all the existing members I haven’t gotten to know yet. I’m ready to have so much fun this year and I hope you get to know me and the rest of the FASA Executive and Officer Board!!!
