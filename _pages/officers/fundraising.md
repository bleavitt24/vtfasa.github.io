> Hey I'm Nat and I'm so excited to be 1/2 of your fundraising committee!!! Some of my hobbies include sleeping forever, eating chocolate, and watching disney movies (I promise I'm only half as lazy as I seem lol). Also, like everyone else, I'm addicted to boba, but I'm too scared to try anything other than taro :D

### **Where are you from?**
> *Chantilly, VA*

### **If you could live anywhere in the world where would it be and why?**

> *Peru, so I could happily live with all the alpacas*

### **Would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck (and why)?**

> *One horse sized duck because 100 little horses would overwhelm and easily topple me.*

### **What would your rapper name be?**

### **Dream Job (and why)?**

> *I would want to be one of those people that have a show where they travel around the world eating all kinds of food. It's like you're getting paid to travel and eat. *
